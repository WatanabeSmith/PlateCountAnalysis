This is an attempt at analyzing the limiting dilution plating experiments in my
ongoing Acquired Mutations project. No analysis has been performed to this point.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

RawData <- read.csv("PlateSortResults.csv")
summary(RawData)
head(RawData)
```

We should start by getting an idea for Plating Efficiency (PE) from the WEHI wells

```{r}
WEHIonly <- RawData %>% filter(Media == "WEHI")
summary(WEHIonly)
WEHIcomplete <- WEHIonly %>% filter(!is.na(WellsGrown))
summary(WEHIcomplete)
Wpercents <- WEHIcomplete %>% transform(GrowthPercent = WellsGrown / WellsPlated)
summary(Wpercents)
hist(Wpercents$GrowthPercent)

```

Which conditions gave the low end of the growth percent?

```{r}
Wlowgrowth <- Wpercents %>% filter(GrowthPercent < 0.4)
Wlowgrowth


```
